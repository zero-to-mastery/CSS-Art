# CSS ART - General Edition

Welcome to CSS Art, a fun, beginner-friendly challenge for Hacktoberfest!

What shapes, pictures and animations can you come up with, using plain HTML divs and CSS? Let's showcase the artistry of ZTM students, and get a free t-shirt into the bargain!
If you're not sure what this is or how to go about doing it, take a look at [this tutorial](https://codepen.io/mikemang/post/a-beginner-s-guide-to-pure-css-images), which will teach you all about how to make pure CSS images.

# What is Hacktoberfest?
Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-source software! All you have to do to take part is sign up on [their website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)  - and make five pull requests in the month of October. Any pull request to any public repo on Github will count, which means, of course, that any PRs you make to this project will help you on your way to getting a cool t-shirt!

# Instructions

If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines . That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!


# Rules

The rules are simple. You have to:

- Use HTML `<divs>` and CSS only! No JS, and no SVGs!
- Have at least one animation in your work
- Please make sure that the code is indeed your own, and not copied from someone else
- That's it!

**All discussions around this event can now be had in our #hacktoberfest-2019 channel on Discord!**

# How to contribute

If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at [https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!

A cool resource to learn about the fork workflow can also be found here - [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the Art directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself.
2. Within this folder you just made, create two files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.
3. Link your CSS file to your HTML file.
4. Using only HTML and CSS (no `<script>` allowed!!), create a work of art! It can be as simple or as complex as you like, as long as it's animated in some way!
5. Get a screen recording of your finished work, **and make a gif**! Try to crop it so that it looks good as a smallish (preferably squarish) image. Save this in your directory, together with your HTML and CSS files. Static screenshots are also acceptable.  
   _If you don't add a gif/screenshot, the website won't show your animation._
6. Go to the root `include.js`. You will see an array of objects, each one represents a work of art that someone has created. Copy the example object below and paste it at the end, filling it out with your art information and links:

```js
let cards = [
  //  Add your card in this section
  {
    artName: "Your art name here",
    pageLink: "./Art/Joy/triangle/triangle.html",
    imageLink: "./Art/Joy/triangle/triangle.gif",
    author: "Joy",
    githubLink: "https://github.com/royranger",
  },
]
```

And congratulations! You're all done. Have fun!
